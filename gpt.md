StyleByZaga presents Fashion and lifestyle
I have an idea to create a fashion and lifestyle brand business with website and app. We will be making custom and unique designs and apparels with other luxurious items and accessories, we will be doing luxurious shopping for high end customers and celebrities that have unique taste and need a personal concierge to style them. We will also parter with top brands and showcase luxurious items like cars, apartments, jewelries, private jets, red carpet prep and design. Also other luxurious personal concierge shoppers can sign up and register so customers and clients can pick who they want to pimp them up. I want this to be unique and one of a kind.

Perfect. Here's how we’ll proceed in phases to bring StyleByZaga to life:

PHASE 1: Brand Identity + Logo Concepts
Brand Name: StyleByZaga
Clean, memorable, and personal—invokes exclusivity and fashion sense.

Tagline Ideas:
“Luxury. Styled for You.”

“Elevate Your Essence.”

“Because Ordinary Doesn’t Cut It.”

Logo Concepts (Visual Direction):
Minimal Luxe: Sleek serif font (like Didot) in gold/black with a crown or hanger detail subtly embedded in the "Z".

Modern Iconic: Monogram-style “SBZ” in a geometric emblem with a diamond or runway base.

Abstract Symbol: A stylized peacock feather (symbol of luxury and style) paired with elegant typography.

I can create visuals for each concept if you'd like. Just confirm your style preference (minimal, modern, abstract).

Here’s a 10-slide outline to build an investor/partner pitch deck:
